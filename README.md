# Solar Panel Defect Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview

Solar panels are widely used to generate renewable energy. However, their performance can degrade due to various defects or environmental conditions such as dust accumulation, bird droppings, snow cover, physical damage, or electrical burns. Regular manual inspection is time-consuming and inefficient, especially for large-scale solar farms.

This project presents an automated approach to detecting and classifying different types of defects in solar panels using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. A simple web-based interface is provided for users to upload images and receive defect classification results.

## Objectives

- To develop a deep learning-based image classification model capable of detecting defects in solar panels.
- To categorize panel images into six classes:
  - Clean
  - Dusty
  - Bird-drop
  - Electrical-damage
  - Physical-Damage
  - Snow-Covered
- To train and evaluate a CNN model on labeled image data.
- To save the trained model in `.h5` format for deployment.
- To build an interactive web application using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
